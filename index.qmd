# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to my learning diary for CASA0023!

My name is Yujin Pan. I graduated from in China with a Bachelor's degree in Urban and Rural Planning.My research interests are mainly in the areas of spatial accessibility and urban public facilities optimisation, and I hope that my postgraduate studies will enable me to understand and learn more about the rich and advanced technologies that guide my studies and work on urban planning.

Thanks to Andy for guiding me and the course!
