    "text": "2.2 Application\nRemote sensing has a wide range of applications in many fields. For example, Remote sensing is widely used in agriculture.Traditionally, satellite imagery has been used for crop condition assessment and type mapping of crops, but due to the limited resolution of the sensors, satellites have been used over large areas. With technological advances, finer subscale green can enable remote sensing applications in the field for disaster assessments such as droughts and floods(Wójtowicz M,2016).Through the application of remote sensing, producers and governments can prevent natural disasters in advance and minimise economic losses.Remote sensing also plays an important role in crop yield forecasting. In the Southern Alberta of Canada, for example, remote sensing is used to assess the extent to which the area is vulnerable to drought conditions and to make yield forecasts. This can provide some support for local agricultural planning and reduce economic risk(Xu W,2011)."

It is useful for me.I have learnt about the types of remote sensors, the format of remote sensing data and the resolution this week. However, my extra-curricular study of remote sensing is far from adequate. I have only studied the application areas of remote sensing in detail from agriculture this week, but I have not studied marine exploration and emergency disaster relief in depth."

The atmospheric correction process is applied to remove the effects of the atmosphere that contribute to the signal measured by a satellite sensor. The objective of this process is the discrimination, from top-of-atmosphere radiance, of the signal emerging from the sea carrying information on the materials suspended and dissolved in seawater. The atmospheric correction of coastal data is challenged by the presence of continental aerosols, bottom reflectance, and adjacency of land."

An example is the delivery of the UK Hotspot Toolkit. Through the collection of EO data, SUHI data is obtained and spatially visualised to give the government and citizens a clear picture of the hotspots that need to be focused on, providing specific geographical information on the location of the next solutions to the urban heat island problem. The Indian literature, on the other hand, provides possible correlates for addressing climate equity and can assist the government in providing direction for addressing equity issues. However, I believe that the current work is still far from adequate and that workflows need to be proposed for New York to mitigate the urban heat island problem and achieve climate equity, such as how to green the infrastructure and how to conduct urban temperature implementation monitoring."
